# Kuru-Kuru-App
Clicker App featuring the hit character Herta from JRPG Honkai: Star Rail!

This is a clicker app that outputs Herta's signature "Kuru Kuru" sound as she spins! It counts how many clicks you do as well
as having little flavor text milestones based on how many clicks you do!

Currently, this app is still under develeopmenet, so there may be some minor issues with performance.

Happy Kuru'ing!

version 1.2.0

When trying to run the application, DON'T tamper with the 'audio' or 'pics' file! The contents inside are needed there for the application to launch and run properly! You can open the file and view the
contents with no downsides of course lol.

Also, if you want the application to be fully terminated after closing it, go to your "Task Manager" program, right click the Kuru Application (It will most likely be in the 'Background Processes' tab), and
click "End Task". This will completely close the app in the background.

*-------Options Functionality-------------*
Quick tip - When using the options menu, drag it off the main window of the program so that way it doesn't 
            disappear! This should be a quick fix in the next update!

Otherwise... 

Happy Kuru'ing!
